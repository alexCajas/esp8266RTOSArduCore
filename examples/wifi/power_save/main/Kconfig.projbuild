            Power save mode for the esp8266 to use. Modem sleep mode includes minimum and maximum power save modes.
            In minimum/maximum power save mode, station wakes up every DTIM to receive beacon. Broadcast data will not be
            lost because it is transmitted after DTIM. However, it can not save much more power if DTIM is short
            for DTIM is determined by AP.
